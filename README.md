Email Town - A virtual town inside of an email thread!

I know, I know, the idea is insane, it did come from a fever dream after all....

But anyways!

Email Town works by using Node Mailer to reply to specific email threads, and add HTML content to them, therefore creating a "town".

Sorry for the messy code in index.js guys. I had a massive server problem and had to copy and paste code EVERYWHERE.
